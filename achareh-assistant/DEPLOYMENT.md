# ðŸ§  Achareh Assistant â€” Deployment & Testing Guide

## 1. Prerequisites  
Make sure the following are installed on your system:  
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose** (optional)
- Internet connection (required for the first image build)

---

## 2. Build and Run the Service  

### Build the Docker image:
```bash
sudo docker build -t achareh-assistant .
```

### Run the container:
```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data achareh-assistant
```

ðŸ—‚ The SQLite database will be automatically created at `./data/conversations.db`.  
If the `data/` directory does not exist, create it first:
```bash
mkdir data
```

---

## 3. Testing the Service  

### 3.1. Send a sample message to the assistant:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_id": 1, "message": "I need home cleaning service"}'
```

#### Sample Response:
```json
{
  "response": "The home cleaning service is available in your city. Would you like to see the pricing details?",
  "service_slug": "home-cleaning"
}
```

---

### 3.2. View stored conversations:
```bash
sudo apt install sqlite3
sqlite3 data/conversations.db
```

Inside the SQLite shell, run:
```sql
.tables;
SELECT * FROM conversations;
```

- The project is designed with a simple, scalable, and modular architecture for easy extension.  
- New endpoints can be added easily to handle additional Achareh services.
